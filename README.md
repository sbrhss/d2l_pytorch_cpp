# Reproduction of D2L with Pytorch's C++ API
Dive to Deep Learning with Pytorch C++ API

This repository is an ealry stages of itself. I am trying to close the famous book, [Dive to Deep learining](https://d2l.ai/index.html). 
However, the orignial book is based on MXNET and there is another [reposity](https://github.com/dsgiitr/d2l-pytorch) which implements this book with Pytorch's Python API.
In this reposity I will try to implement the content of this book with Pytorch's C++ API.

If there is an issue, please let me know then I can improve it.
